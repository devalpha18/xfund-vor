### Function `makeVORInputSeed(bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _userSeed, address _requester, uint256 _nonce) internal  -> uint256`
To prevent repetition of VOR output due to repetition of the
user-supplied seed, that seed is combined in a hash with the
user-specific nonce, and the address of the consuming contract. The
risk of repetition is mostly mitigated by inclusion of a blockhash in
the final seed, but the nonce does protect against repetition in
requests which are included in a single block.


#### Parameters:
- `_userSeed`: VOR seed input provided by user

- `_requester`: Address of the requesting contract

- `_nonce`: User-specific nonce at the time of the request

### Function `makeRequestId(bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _vORInputSeed) internal  -> bytes32`
Note that _vORInputSeed is not the seed passed by the consuming
contract, but the one generated by makeVORInputSeed
#### Parameters:
- `_keyHash`: The serviceAgreement ID to be used for this request

- `_vORInputSeed`: The seed to be passed directly to the VOR

#### Return Values:
- The id for this request
