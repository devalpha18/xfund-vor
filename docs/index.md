# VOR Introduction

This documentation covers VOR (Verified Open Randomness), which allows smart contract
developers to request unpredictable, proovable randomness for their contracts, and pay for it in xFUND.

There are documentation and guides covering how to integrate the `VORConsumerBase` smart contract 
library (required for interacting with the `VORCoordinator` network) into your own smart 
contract and how to interact with the network in order to request and receive randomness 
in your smart contract.
